## Information

This software is designed for the official raspberry pi touch display (800 x 480px). If you're going to develop on your local environment run you favored browser and set resolution to `800px x 480px` via Devtools (normaly F12) than go on with these steps:

1. **You need to have NodeJS and NPM installed locally**

2. **Obtain an API-Key from openweathermap.org**

You need to obtain an API-key from openweathermap for the included weather forecast. After you got one, add it to the `url` in `/routes/weatherforecast/weatherforecast.js`.

3. **Create a database.js file inside /config folder**

Create a new file inside the `/config` folder and name it `database.js`. This is where your database connect information goes. It should look something like this:

    module.exports = {
        database: 'mongodb://{MONGO_USER}:{MONGO_PASS}@{SERVER_IP:SERVER_PORT}/{AUTH_DB}',
        secret: 'SecretYouLike'
    }

a free database for testing purposes for example can be created on https://mlab.com/

4. **Install packages via `npm i`**

Install dependencys in `/` and `angular-src` via `npm i`

5. **Start anything**

* Start server in `/` with `nodemon` for example
* Start angular dev environment via `ng serve` inside /angular-src
